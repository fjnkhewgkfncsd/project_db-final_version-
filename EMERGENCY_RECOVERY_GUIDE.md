- **Environment-based Authentication**: Credentials stored securely in `.env.recovery`
- **Database-Independent**: Works even when main database is completely down
- **Admin-Only Access**: Special emergency credentials separate from regular user accounts
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All recovery actions are logged with timestamps

### Safety
- **Pre-restore Validation**: Checks backup file integrity before restoration
- **Pre-restore Backup**: Creates safety backup before restoration (when possible)
- **Post-restore Verification**: Validates restoration success
- **Careful Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks

### User Experience
- **Modern React Interface**: Clean, responsive UI for emergency operations
- **Real-time Status**: Live database status monitoring

3. Lists available backup files with metadata

### 3. Backup Selection
1. Review available backup files
2. Select appropriate backup for restoration
3. Confirm restoration operation

### 4. Safe Restoration
1. **Pre-checks**: Validate backup file integrity
2. **Safety Backup**: Create current state backup (if database accessible)
3. **Restoration**: Execute restore operation with progress monitoring
4. **Verification**: Validate restoration success
5. **Logging**: Record all actions and results

## üìù Logging and Monitoring

### Recovery Logs
- Location: `logs/recovery.log`
- Format: `[timestamp] message`
- Includes: Authentication attempts, operations, errors, and results

### Log Categories
- **Authentication**: Login attempts and results
- **Operations**: Backup listing, restore operations
- **Errors**: Failed operations and error details
- **Verification**: Post-restore validation results

## üöÄ Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Server Down
1. Main application cannot connect to database
2. Access emergency recovery at http://localhost:3002
3. Login with emergency credentials
4. Select and restore from latest backup
5. Verify database is accessible again

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption
1. Database is accessible but data is corrupted
2. Access emergency recovery through main app (/emergency-recovery)
3. System creates pre-restore backup
4. Restore from known good backup
5. Verify data integrity

### Scenario 3: Failed Migration
1. Database migration caused issues
2. Emergency recovery creates safety backup of current state
3. Restore from pre-migration backup
4. Review and fix migration scripts

#### Authentication Fails
- **Check Credentials**: Verify username/password in `.env.recovery`
- **Check File Path**: Ensure `.env.recovery` is in backend directory
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure file is readable

#### No Backup Files Found
- **Check Directory**: Verify `backups` directory exists
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure directory is readable
- **Check File Extensions**: Only `.sql` and `.backup` files are shown

#### Restore Fails
- **Check Database Connection**: Verify database credentials in environment
- **Check Backup File**: Ensure backup file is not corrupted
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure backup file is readable
- **Check Database State**: Some restores require database to be accessible

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View recent recovery logs
tail -f logs/recovery.log

# Search for errors
grep -i error logs/recovery.log

# Search for specific operations
grep -i "restore" logs/recovery.log
```
